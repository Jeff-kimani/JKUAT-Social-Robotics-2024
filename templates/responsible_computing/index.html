    <div class="w-full h-1 bg-black mb-4"></div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-raleway font-normal mt-4 mx-5 md:mx-20">INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p class="font-lato font-normal mb-4 mx-5 md:mx-20">
        Eunice Njeri, a lecturer in the Department of Computing at JKUAT and Principal Investigator (PI) for the Mozilla Responsible Computing project, is the lead of this initiative that aims to promote responsible computing practices among students. The project is a collaborative effort with Professor Kimani and is supported by four MSc students: Caroline Kabuti, Erick Otieno, Paul Demo, and Peter Kaburu.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-raleway font-normal mt-4 mx-5 md:mx-20">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p class="font-lato font-normal mb-4 mx-5 md:mx-20">
        The core objective of the Mozilla Responsible Computing project is to train computer science and technology students on ethical computing practices. The training integrates ethical considerations into the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) courses. This approach covers human-centered design principles and responsible computing, with a focus on applying these concepts to the development of robotic applications.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-raleway font-normal mt-4 mx-5 md:mx-20">TRAINING METHODOLOGY</h3>
    <p class="font-lato font-normal mb-3 mx-5 md:mx-20">
        The training begins with introducing students to the principles of responsible computing. After theoretical introductions, students are divided into groups to work on practical projects. They are encouraged to explore lab environments, generate project ideas, and incorporate responsible computing practices into their designs.
    </p>
    <p class="font-lato font-normal mb-3 mx-5 md:mx-20">
        Students receive instruction on various aspects of responsible computing, which they apply during lab sessions and the implementation of their projects. The evaluation process includes presenting their projects and demonstrating how ethical considerations have been integrated into their designs. Group presentations encourage peer-to-peer learning and help students better understand the principles of responsible computing.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-raleway font-normal mt-4 mx-5 md:mx-20">IMPACT AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>
    <p class="font-lato font-normal mb-3 mx-5 md:mx-20">
        In just a few months, the project has made significant strides in education and technology, resulting in several noteworthy achievements. These include solutions for children with special needs, improved accessibility in AI applications, and innovative applications demonstrating the importance of ethical computing practices. By incorporating AI and responsible computing, the project has broadened these fields to address critical societal issues, promoting ethical adherence.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class=" text-2xl font-raleway font-normal mt-4 mx-5 md:mx-20 ">LESSONS LEARNED</h3>
    <p class="font-lato font-normal mb-3 mx-5 md:mx-20">
        The project has provided valuable insights into data protection and privacy, aligning with Mozillaâ€™s guidelines for responsible data collection and storage. Students are taught to apply ethical decision-making frameworks, focusing on obtaining explicit consent and ensuring data privacy, particularly in sensitive sectors like healthcare.
