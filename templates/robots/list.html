        NAO is a robot with a knack for knowledge – both learning and sharing
        it. Fluent in over 20 languages, communicates effortlessly with
        students from diverse cultures. NAO is equipped with tactile sensors
        in its head, hands, and feet. NAO responds to its environment by
        recognizing people and their emotions. Designed for natural movement,

        Fully programmable, NAO operates on the flexible NAOqi OS, offering
        customization through various Software Development Kits, visual
        programming interfaces like Blockly and Scratch, and user-friendly
        graphical software like Choregraphe.
