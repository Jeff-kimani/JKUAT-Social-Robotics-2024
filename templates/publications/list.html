            Abstract : At present, robots are showing increasing potential to be incorporated efficiently into various social settings, for example, in educational and therapeutic facilities for children and nursing homes for elderly among others [5, 8, 24]. Accordingly,
            it is increasingly important to design natural social behaviors for robots. In human–human interactions, people rely on non-verbal cues such as gaze, gestures, body language, and facial expressions to communicate. Feldman and Rimé [17], showed
            that non-verbal cues contribute significantly to the meaning exchanged in the interaction. Therefore, implementing these cues in social human–robot interaction may increase its naturalness and effectiveness.
